                <p>Anyway, this is the “About” page, so I should probably tell you my story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em><\Insert Flashback Sequence></\Insert></em>
                </p>
                <p>In my younger days, I was on the track towards medical school(Medcine and Surgery), but was detoured on the way by the quest for Admission. As years passed I settled for an alternative course (Computer Science), then did I realized humanity can be helped or even saved through software development.</p>
                <h3 class="inLove">She Fell in Love</h3>
                <p class="school">I found the love of my life few months before Industrial Training, a friend of mine one afternoon came to my room so excited, she wanted to demonstrate something to me but I was watching movie(that’s what majority of students do with their PC, I was no different). Her excitement was overwhelming that I gave her an opportunity. Guess what! she wrote some foreign characters, opened my browser and boom!!! the miracle happened; <span id="g">G</span><span id="o1">o</span><span id="o2">o</span><span id="g">g</span><span id="l">l</span><span id="o1">e</span> written bodily with its 4 different colours appeared on the screen, immediately I fell in love.
My love grew into passion that I gave up my little savings to learn web development using java for back end. The journey have not been easy but I have this inner peace that am doing what I love the most.</p>
                
                <h2>This is why you should choose me</h2>
                <p>Chiamaka is a strong innovative individual having unwavering passion for software development in general, solving
real life problems through software development, thus contributing to economic growth.</p>
                <p>Having completed my education, my dream is to be a world class developer, initiate and complete innovative projects, and have a voice in the technology ecosystem. Lack of funds has always been a limiting factor to my growth. As a female, getting a mentor who will see my vision, invest in me and see me grow, has also been challenging.  </p>
                <p>
                    It’ll be dreams come true for me, if I’m chosen among those that will be trained as web developers, as this will give me an opportunity to work closely with a passion driven company, learn diverse technologies, develop industry needed skills, and grow my network; most importantly land an amazing internship or job opportunity. I am teachable, can relate well with people and can work for hours, but I know more is needed. Being a fast learner, passionate about programming, determined to be successful, I know I am fit for the offer.</p>
